            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>It is againe to be marked, that the Apoſtle hauing found<note place="margin">If wee ſeeke comfort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from the wrath to come, we muſt goe out of our ſelues and ſeeke it in Chriſt.</note> in himſelfe matter of death, which he humbly confeſſed in the end of the laſt Chapter, doth now goe out of himſelfe, and reſt in Ieſus Chriſt, before hee can finde any comfort through deliuerance from death, teaching vs, that if wee ſeeke comfort, wee muſt goe out of our ſelues, and ſeeke it in Chriſt. Surely a great cauſe of theſe manifold doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, feares, and vnquietneſſe of mind, wherewith the godly are often troubled, is that they ſeeke in themſelues grounds and warrants of their ſaluation; as though the Lord could not ſaue them, vnleſſe there be in them ſuch a diſpoſition, as in euery point ſhould be. This is one of Sathans ſubtile ſtratagems, to draw thee from Chriſt and make thee to reſt vpon thy ſelfe: if once he obtaine this at thy hands, &amp; thou ſuffer that Serpent to creepe in between thee and thy ſurety, and diuert thy heart from repoſing ſtedfaſtly vpon Chriſt, that not content to ſeeke ſupplement of thy wants in him

Learne therefore from the holy Apoſtle, that how euer in thy ſelfe thou be worthie to dye, yet giue this glory to Ieſus Chriſt, that he is thy Sauiour, be ſtrong in him, keepe thy conſideration and confidence vpon him. If Sathan charge thee with thy ſinnes, flye thou to Chriſts merits; if hee obiect to thee thine euill actions, remember thou Chriſts innocent ſufferings; and for euery thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he can charge thee, goe thou to Ieſus thy aduocate, to be anſwerable for thee.

Thus the Apoſtle by an holy wiſedome doth order his ſpeech for the comfort of the children of GOD: for leaſt that other weake Chriſtians might be diſcouraged by reaſon of their ſinnes, hee ſpeakes of remanent ſinfull corruption in his owne perſon, to declare that none, no, not the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are exempted from it.

In the end of<note place="margin">1 By Scripture.</note> the laſt Chapter, the Apoſtle condemneth the motions of concupiſcence for ſinne, euen when conſent is not giuen vnto them: for he proteſts of himſelfe that he reſiſted theſe motions of ſin, but was oftentimes ſore againſt his will cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued by them, he condemnes them as euill, albeit he gaue no conſent vnto them: for the Law (as I haue ſaid) doth not onely condemne ſinne in the branch, but alſo in the roote: <hi>there ſhall not be in thee an euill thought againſt the Lord thy God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this is alſo confirmed by reaſon.

It is not then the conſent following, that makes the preceeding motion to be euill, but it is the preceeding euill motion, that makes the ſubſequent conſent euill.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:22742:29"/> freed from ſinne, what can condemne vs? How Chriſt hath freed vs from the law of ſinne, he explaines in the next two verſes: there is in ſinne a twofold law, that is, a twofold power; firſt, a commaunding power; ſecondly a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power: but in Chriſt there is a law, that is, a power of the liuely ſpirit, or a liuely ſpirituall power, deliuering vs from them both. For firſt from the condemning power of<note place="margin">Shewing how we are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both from the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſinne.</note> ſinne hee ſhewes we are deliuered by the merit of Chriſts death, and ſuffering in the fleſh, whereby he hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinne: which merit imputed to vs that are in him; doth ſo free vs, that ſinne hath no force nor power to condemne vs in iudgement, and this he handleth in the third verſe. Secondly, he ſhewes how we are deliuered from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding power of ſinne, by the liuely vertue of Ieſus Chriſt, which being communicated vnto vs quickneth vs, and maketh vs to begin to fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the law, ſo that refuſing to walke after the fleſh, we endeauour to walke after the ſpirit, and this he handles in the fourth verſe: ſhewing that the end why Chriſt hath condemned ſinne in his fleſh, is that he might ſanctifie vs to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his holy law, whereunto at the laſt he ſhall make vs fully conformable. Thus you ſee how that former ground of comfort is confirmed vnto vs, howſoeuer by nature wee were vnder the law of ſinne, and conſequently vnder dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet now by Chriſt we are freed from all law of ſin, and ſo freed alſo from condemnation.</p>
                        <p>The phraſes vſed here by the Apoſtle, makes his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<note place="margin">Phraſes vſed by the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> ſeeme to be the more obſcure, therefore will we firſt explane them. This phraſe, <hi>the spirit of life in Chriſt,</hi> is more ſignificant than that well it can be expreſſed in ſo few effectuall termes. The Apoſtle was ſent a Doctor to the Gentiles, yet doth he labour earneſtly to conuert the Iewes; for both their edifications hee ſo tempers his ſtile, that ſpeaking to the Gentiles in the Grecian language, hee keepes the Hebrew phraſe, which as I ſaid makes his ſpeech appeare the harder. <hi>The spirit of life in Chriſt,</hi> then, is no
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:22742:30"/> other thing but the life of Chriſt, like that <hi>Reuel.</hi> 11. 11. Againe, <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Christ,</hi> is no other thing but that forcible working liuely power which is in Chriſt: for it is cuſtomable to the holy Apoſtle to vſe the word <hi>law</hi> to expreſſe any thing, wherein there is a commaunding or working power; ſo he hath aſcribeth a law to ſinne, a law to his members, a law to death, and now very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hee oppones vnto them <hi>a law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt:</hi> which is more liuely and powerfull to ſaue, to free, and to quicken, then any law that hath contrary power, can be able to deſtroy, captiue, or ſlay them who are in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Thus the words being expounded, the firſt leſſon will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe<note place="margin">Our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Sathan, ſin, and death, are ſtrong, but our Sauiour is ſtronger.</note> out of the Apoſtles manner of ſpeech, who aſcribing to ſinne and death a law, which may condemne and deſtroy, aſcribes to Chriſt a more powerfull law, to iuſtifie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. Moſt ſure then is our eſtate who are in Ieſus Chriſt, for there is a power in our Lord, which ſhall bring euery contrary power of man and Angell in ſubiection to him:<note place="margin">Comfort.</note> that tyrant ſinne hath indeede oppreſſed and ouer-ruled many a one, but our Lord Ieſus the valiant conquerour hath a mighty power able to diſanull the law of ſinne: and Sathan is that ſtrong one who by nature poſſeſſes the heart of man, as his owne houſe, but Ieſus is that ſtronger one, who will diſpoſſeſſe him and caſt him out of the hearts of all ſuch as are his: <hi>The God of peace ſhall ſhortly tread Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than vnder our feet,</hi> and therefore ſuppoſe we be weake in<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 20.</note> our ſelues, yet we will reioyce in the ſtrength of the Lord Ieſus.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we learne here that without Chriſt we liued<note place="margin">In what a vile bondage wee liued by nature</note> in a vile ſeruitude and bondage, of all ſeruants thoſe are in worſt caſe who are ſould, and of thoſe who are ſould, they are worſt who muſt doe ſeruice in priſon, and of them who are in priſon, moſt lamentable is their eſtate who are chayned and bound in priſon, yet ſuch ſeruants were we by nature before Chriſt made vs free, we were not onely the ſeruants of ſinne, and ſould vnder ſinne, as witneſſeth the

Our oppreſſors in this bondage, are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and Sinne, and ſinnes of ſo many ſorts, as doe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſtract the ſoule. Pride one while vſurping dominion ouer vs; Auarice another while vendicating a ſeat to her ſelfe with power to commaund vs; Concupiſcence moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly challenging vs to doe her ſeruice, as our ſoueraigne. <hi>Sic certant in me de me ipſo cuius potiſſimum eſſe videar,</hi> thus<note place="margin">Ber. hom. 4.</note> doe they ſtriue within me (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) about me to which of their dominion I ſhould appertaine. That which hee confeſſed of himſelfe, all the Godly may feele in their owne experience, innumerable are thoſe tyrants that ſtriue among themſelues, but all of them ſtriue againſt vs to haue domination ouer vs, but indeed theſe are vncouth Lords, and ſuch as can claime no title nor right ouer vs, wee are the workemanſhip of God, the redeemed of the Lord, and are bound to doe ſeruice to none but to him alone. O Lord therefore come downe and poſſeſſe thine owne kingdome, erect a throne to thy ſelfe in our hearts, that thou by thy Spirit may raigne in vs as our King, and make vs free from theſe tyrants that would oppreſſe vs.</p>
                        <p>But that we may the better perceiue how abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this bondage.</note> this ſeruitude is, let vs out of the Apoſtles words marke theſe three things: firſt, how this dominion is tyrannicall: ſecondly, how the commaundements of theſe tyrants are all wicked: and thirdly, are all deadly; theſe three he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſhortly, when he ſaith that Chriſt hath freed vs from <hi>the law of ſinne and death.</hi> Firſt then, he aſcribeth vnto ſinne<note place="margin">How a Law is aſcribed vnto ſinne.</note> a Law, not as if ſin proceeded by a Law, (properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) or that there were any lawfulneſſe in ſinne, but onely to poynt out the tyranny thereof: for as Rulers ordayned by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:22742:31"/> God haue their owne Lawes by which they gouerne their Subiects in iuſtice, ſo hath alſo tyrannous vſurpers their owne commandements, to the obedience whereof they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force ſuch as are vnder them. And this tyrranny the Apoſtle here aſcribe vnto ſinne.</p>
                        <p>A tyrranny lawleſſe, and moſt intollerable: for where<note place="margin">1 Sin is ſuch an intollerable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as neuer ſuffers his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to reſt.</note> as any other oppreſſor will ſometime giue reſt to ſuch as are vnder his bondage. Euen in Egypt vnder <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Iſraelites had licenſe to refreſh themſelues with meate, and drink, and ſleep; this ſpirituall oppreſſor giues no reſt to his miſerable captiues, but whether they eate, or drinke, or ſleep hee alwaies exacts the ſeruice of ſinne from them, ſo that he doth in ſuch ſort lye in wait to ſnare the children of God, <hi>Vt faciat aliquando dormientibus, quod non poteſt vigilanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>

And if ſo he doe to the Saints, what meruaile if he turmoyle the minde of his Captiues vnceſſantly with vncleane cogitations? When Sathan had once put it into the minde of <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray Ieſus, did hee ſuffer him to reſt till he had performed it? no indeed, hee permitted him not ſo much as to eate his meate, but haſtned him from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accompliſh his ſinne hee had intended: and <hi>Ammon</hi> being once entiſed to defile his ſiſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> was ſo vexed that his fleſh melted away, and his minde had no reſt.

As an vnruly and vntamed horſe, the more he is ſpurred foreward the faſter he runnes backward: ſo the peruerſe nature of man, <hi>nititur ſemper in vetitum,</hi> is ſo farre from being reformed by the law, that by the contrary, ſinne that was dead without the law, is reuiued by the law, and takes occaſion to worke in vs all manner of concupiſcence.

                        <p>Firſt, he is vnto them a ſpirit of Sanctification, renuing<note place="margin">Three effects wrought by the ſpeciall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the ſpirit in the godly.</note> their hearts by his effectuall grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he firſt rebukes them of ſinne, he wakens their conſcience with ſome ſight of their iniquities, and ſenſe of that wrath which ſinne hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: whereof ariſes heauineſſe in their hearts, ſadneſſe in their countenance, lamentation in their ſpeech, and ſuch an<note place="margin">1 Sanctification.</note> alteration in their whole behauiour, that their former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures become painefull vnto them, and others who knew them before wonders to ſee ſuch a change in them.

                        <p>This is the firſt operation of the ſpirit, but it is not all, he proceeds yet further by degrees: for the kingdome of God is as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the earth, which growes vp and we cannot tell how, firſt it ſends out the blade, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the eares, and then the cornes; ſo proceeds the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in man by degrees.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22742:64"/> as we our ſelues who ſpake them are not able to repeat againe.</p>
                        <p>And thirdly he becomes vnto them the ſpirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,<note place="margin">3 Conſolation.</note> if he be vnto thee a ſanctifier, and interceſſor, he ſhall not faile at the laſt to be thy comforter: if at the firſt after that thou haſt ſent vp ſupplications, thou find not his conſolation deſcending vpon thee, be not diſcouraged, but be the more humbled; for alas our ſinnes ſhortens his arme,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> and the hardneſſe of our hearts holds out his comforts: we muſt fall downe with <hi>Marie,</hi> and lye ſtill waſhing the feet of Chriſt with our teares, before he take vs in his armes to kiſſe vs with the kiſſes of his mouth; and if we finde theſe effects of his preſence going before, humiliation of our heart, and the grace of prayer, we may be out of all doubt that his conſolations ſhall follow after.</p>

                        <p>Now to the comfort: we haue by Ieſus Chriſt a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold<note place="margin">The comfort of Ethnikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hainſt death, not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ours, and our courage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to theirs.</note> comfort againſt death, whereof two onely here are touched. The firſt that the death whereunto we are ſubiect is not totall. The ſecond, that the nature and qualitie of our bodilie death is changed. The third that it is not perpetuall, the body ſhall not for euer lye vnder death. The Ethnicks had alſo their owne ſilly comforts, but nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ours. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> records that <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Queene of Aegypt, demaunding of certaine learned men, what kinde of death was without the bitter ſenſe of paine, receiued this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: there is no death without dolour, but that death was moſt gentle which was brought on by the Serpent <hi>Aſpis:</hi> and namely that kinde thereof which is called <hi>Hypnale:</hi> be cauſe they whoſe fleſh is enuenomed with the poyſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe incontinently ſleepe vnto death: for which cauſe alſo ſhee made choyſe of it. And <hi>Seneca</hi> being by <hi>Nero</hi> to be executed to death, got it left to his owne pleaſure, (as great fauour ſhewed vnto him) to make choyſe of any death he pleaſed, he choſe to bleed to death in hote water. Others among them that offered themſelues to moſt fearefull deaths, ſuch as <hi>Curtius Regulus,</hi> and others, had no comfort to ſuſtaine them, but a ſilly hope of immortall fame of their affection to their country. It was (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) the ſilly comfort of the Gentiles: againſt the want of buriall, <hi>Coelo tegitur, qui non habet vrnam,</hi> and as comfortleſſe is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of many baſtard Chriſtians, which ſtands onely in a fayre Sepulcher, prouided before hand for themſelues, in an honourable buriall, commanded &amp; expected of them before death, and in abundance of worldly things which they leaue to theirs behinde them, all which as ſaith the ſame Father,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22742:67"/> 
                           <hi>viuorum ſunt ſolatia non mortuorum,</hi> are comforts to them that liue behinde, but no help to them who are dead. I note this, that conſidering the magnanimitie of theſe Ethnicks in ſuffering of death, notwithſtanding the weake and ſmall comforts which they had to ſuſtaine them, we may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our puſillanimitie, who hauing from Chriſt moſt excellent comforts againſt death, are afraide at the ſmalleſt remembrance thereof.

                        <p>This is a doctrine commonly talked of, that man conſiſts of a ſoule and a body, but is not ſo duely conſidered, as it ſhould. It is a fearefull puniſhment which by nature lyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoule, ſeeing ſhe turned her ſelfe willingly away from God, ſhe is ſo farre deſerted of God, that ſhe regards not her ſelfe: though it be a very common prouerbe in the mouthes of men, <hi>I haue a ſoule to keepe,</hi> yet haſt thou ſuch a ſoule as can teach thee to keepe any other thing better than it ſelfe: a fearefull plague, that becauſe as I haue ſaid the ſoule conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not in the loue of God, it is now ſo farre deſerted, that it regards not the owne ſelfe. This haue I touched onely to waken vs, that wee may more deepely conſider of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which men thinke they haue learned and know ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently already, namely, that man is a compound creature conſiſting of a ſoule and a body.</p>

The third is the eſtate of grace, wherein the ſoule being reconciled with God by the mediation of Chriſt, and quickned againe by his holy Spirit, the body is left for a while vnder the bands of death. The fourth is the eſtate of glory, wherein both of them being ioyned together againe, ſhall be reſtored to a more happy life than that which they enioyed by creation. As for the firſt eſtate, we haue loſt it; as for the ſecond, the reprobate ſtands in it, and therefore miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is their condition; as for the third, it is the eſtate of the Saints of God vpon earth; as for the fourth, it ſhall be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Saints of God in heauen.</p>

If they had not agreed in one, to diuide themſelues from God, no diuiſion had euer fallen out among themſelues. But that which God made very good, Sathan working vpon the mutability of their will turned into euill; ſo that the woman in ſtead of an helper, became a tempter of the man to ſinne, and the man in ſtead of a defender, became a dilater of the woman to God for ſinne. But the Lord Ieſus, who came into the world, <hi>to deſtroy the workes of the Diuell,</hi> as he hath reconciled man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with God, ſo hath he reunited them among themſelues, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this to all the former bands of their vnion, that now they ſhould liue together as <hi>heires of the grace of life.</hi> In this moſt happy vnion of both your Maiesties with God and among your ſelues, conſists your mutuall ſtrength and comfort, the welfare of your Highneſſe royall children, the terrour of your enemies,

We doe therefore bleſſe the Lord who hath confirmed your royall hearts, and ſet it in the for moſt of your godly cares, how to keepe and encreaſe this holy and happy band of loue which keepeth you both. For the continuance whereof, as after my weake meaſure, I ſtand vp a daily ſupplicant vnto the Lord, among others your Highneſſe loyall ſubiects, ſo doe I humbly craue that your Highneſſe impute it not to me for preſumption, that I haue conioyned your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties in the participation of this ſmall propine of the firſt fruits of my labours, whom I doe wiſh for euer to be conioyned in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all good preſent, and to come: but that rather accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Highneſſe wonted fauour and clemencie toward me, your maiestie would graciouſly accept it, as a testimonie of my earneſt and vnſained affection toward your Highneſſe name and honour in this life, and euerlasting welfare in the life to come.</p>

The ſecond argument is taken from that preſent help which the ſpirit miniſters vnto vs in all our afflictions; <hi>likewiſe the ſpirit alſo helps our infirmities, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 26. The third is, that our afflictions are meanes by which wee are brought to a conformity with Chriſt, whereunto GOD in his eternall counſell hath predeſtinated vs, and ſo are not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge our ſaluation, but by the contrary muſt of neceſſitie worke for the furtherance, and aduancement thereof vnto vs; and this is ſet downe verſe 28 <hi>Alſo wee know that all things, &amp;c.</hi> and confirmed to the 31. verſe.</p>
                        <p>It is not without cauſe that the Apoſtle takes ſo great<note place="margin">Our nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> paines to confirme vs againſt affliction, becauſe our nature abhorres nothing more then it. When Ieſus went vp to the mountaine to preach, all his Diſciple, went with him, but when he went to mount Caluarie to ſuffer they all fled from him; he hath many Diſciples to follow him by profeſſion, but few to follow him by patient ſuffering.

Secondly, hee receiued it not grudgingly nor impatiently, but with an humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his will, to the will of his Father. Thirdly, hee ſuffered for this end, that he might aboliſh ſin, and deſtroy him who had the power of death. If theſe three concurre in thy ſufferings, thou mayeſt be ſure they are ſuffrings with Chriſt: firſt, if paſſing by the inſtrument of thy trouble, thou looke to the hand of God, tempering and giuing it vnto thee: ſecondly, if thou receiue it with a humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thy ſpirit to him who is the Father of Spirits: and thirdly, if it worke in thee a mortification of thy ſinfull luſts and affections.</p>
                        <p>And of this wee haue to make our vſe in all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt inward Afflictions.</note> inward, or outward: and firſt concerning inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, if at any time it pleaſe the Lord to exerciſe vs with fearefull agonies of Conſcience, let vs looke vnto GOD, who kils and makes aliue, who caſts downe and raiſes vp; let vs for a while beare his indignation, he abides but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his anger: if wee finde that by them wee are more humbled, wakened out of ſecuritie, and ſtirred vp more feruently to pray, and that the life of ſinne is weakened in vs, let vs be out of all doubt, that theſe inward troubles are ſufferings with Chriſt; whoſe ſoule for our ſinnes was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie vnto the death, and his body did ſweat blood, through the vehement anguiſh of his ſpirit.

                        <p>This ſhortneſſe of our afflictions depends vpon the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie<note place="margin">How our life is but the life of a moment.</note> and vanitie of our life, which in the eſtimation of Gods ſpirit is ſo ſhort and vaine a thing, that he vouchſafes not the name of life vpon it, without ſome reſtriction.

But the ſpirit of God, who beſt knowes it, giues vnto it the name of life, as I ſaid, with a reſtriction, he cals it a momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie life, it is but a moment wherein we liue, if we iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right we haue no more: for as for the moments which are paſt, they are dead to thee, and thou to them, and as for the moments which are to come, they are vncertaine, and thou canſt not be ſaid to liue in them; ſo that no more is left to thee wherein thou canſt truely ſay I liue, but a moment, and this alſo muſt ſhortly goe away and giue place to another, that ſo by ſucceſſion of moments one vnto another, thy ſilly life may be prorogued for a while.</p>
                        <p>But this ſhall yet better appeare, if we conſider thoſe ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes<note place="margin">Sacred ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, by which the holy Ghoſt ſhadowes the vanitie of our preſent life. <hi>Iob. 7. 6. Iob. 9.</hi>
                           </note> by which the ſpirit of God deſcribes the vanitie of this our mortall life. Patient <hi>Iob</hi> compares the life of man vnto the Weauers ſhuttle, which ſcarce is in at the one end of the web, when it is out at the other, and hee that lookes vnto it, can hardly perceiue it. Hee compares it alſo to the winde, that quickly flyeth by vs; and to the cloud, which ſpeedily vaniſhes; to a Poſt that runnes diligently and reſts not till he come to his end; to an hungry Eagle in the ayre,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:22742:123"/> who ſeeing her pray a farre off flyeth ſpeedily vpon it; to a flower that flouriſhes at once, but withers in continent; and<note place="margin">Iob. 14.</note> laſt of all to a ſhip ſayling in the ſea before the winde, which for the preſent is ſeene, but within ſhort ſpace appeares no more, yea doth not leaue behinde her any footſtep or token that any ſuch thing was there; and as it is with them who ſaile in her, that how euer they change their action, yet goe they on in their courſe toward their wiſhed Hauen: ſo is it with vs, doe what we will, whether we eate, or wee ſleepe, wee are haſting alway toward our ends. The Pſalmiſt againe compares our life to a ſpanne or hand breadth: to the graſſe<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.</note> which groweth vp in the morning, and is cut downe in the euening: to a ſleepe which ſlips away before wee can know what we were doing in it: to a dreame, which of all things is moſt ſickle and vaine: to a thought, which is not well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, when it is ended: and laſt of all to a declyning ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as is the ſhadow of the Sunne in the ſetting, which a man ſhall ſee on the top of a mountaine leſſe and leſſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing till it be no more.

                        <p>As for the workes therefore which by his holy ſpirit hee<note place="margin">Workes of grace in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are not ſuppleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall merit.</note> workes in good men, hee doth them not as ſupplements to his moſt perfect perſonall merits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo his perſonall merits ſhould be found vnſufficient, which were blaſphemie to thinke: but hee workes them in the godly as effects of his vertue, whereby he communicates to them thoſe benefits, which once in his owne perſon he hath perfectly merited, to wit, righteouſneſſe, and life, and that for the beginning and finiſhing of their conformity with him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, thoſe workes which Chriſt by his Spirit works<note place="margin">They are not pure &amp; perfect.</note> in vs, are in ſuch ſort wrought by him, that they are not wrought without vs, and therefore cannot be perfectly holy, and conſequently meritorious. As the fountaine is ſo muſt the water of the ſpring be; as we our ſelues are ſo muſt our works be: we our ſelues in a great part are vncleane, and vnregenerate, what worke then perfectly cleane and holy can be done by vs?</p>

Wee ſee in this compoſition of the world, that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt things are ſituate in higheſt places; the earth as groſeſt is put in the loweſt roome, the water aboue the earth, the ayre aboue the water, the fire aboue the ayre, the ſpheres of heauen, purer then any of them, aboue the reſt; but the

                        <p>The other part of this vanitie is the abuſe of the creature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is threefold: firſt, concerning God: ſecondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning<note place="margin">The other part of the vanitie is a threefold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the creature.</note> the godly: and thirdly, concerning the wicked.

For the will of the creature is no other thing, but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination of the creature; and the meaning is, that the creature of the owne nature is not ſubiect to this vanitie, but that it is ſubdued vnder it, by the ſuperiour power of God, for the ſinne of man. Where if it be asked how ſtands this<note place="margin">How ſtands it with iuſtice that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is puniſhed for mans ſinne?</note> with iuſtice, that the creature which ſinned not, ſhould be ſubiected to vanitie for the ſinne of man? The queſtion is eaſily anſwered, if wee conſider that the creatures were not made for themſelues, but for the vſe and ſeruice of man, and that whatſoeuer change to the worſe is come vpon them, is not their puniſhment, but a part of ours. If earthly Kings without violation of iuſtice may puniſh their rebels, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their perſons, but by demolition of their houſes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in their goods and ſubſtance, how ſhall we be bold to reproue the Lords doing, who hauing conuinced man of a notorious treaſon, hath not onely puniſhed himſelfe, but defaced the houſe wherein he ſet him to dwell? ſeeing hee hath violated the band of his ſeruice vnto God, what reaſon is it that Gods creatures ſhould continue in the firſt courſe of their ſeruice to him? ſurely it ſtands vvith the righteous iudgement of God, that his creatures ſhould become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe ſeruants to man, ſeeing man of his owne free will is

                        <p>And againe, that the Apoſtle ſayth the change which is<note place="margin">The fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of man, &amp; of the creature compared.</note> made in the creature, is againſt the will of the creature, it ſerues greatly for our humiliation. The fall of Apoſtate Angels was a fall by ſinne, but with their will, and without a Tempter to allure them, and now is without any hope that euer they ſhall be reſtored. The fall of man was alſo a fall by ſinne of his owne free-will, but not without the Tempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>r, and now not without hope of recouerie and reſtitution. But the fall of the creature, was neither a fall of ſinne, nor of their owne will, but a caſting of them downe againſt their will from their originall ſtate, yet not without hope to be deliuered. Miſerable in the higheſt degree are Apoſtate Angels, who of their owne free-will without an exteriour Tempter, haue deſerted their firſt habitation, and caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into remedileſſe condemnation. Miſerable in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree are reprobate men, who haue fallen of their owne free-will, ſuppoſe prouoked by an exteriour Tempter, and ſhall neuer be partaker of the reſtitution of the ſonnes of God. But herein hath the Lord magnified his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, that where we fell with Angels, and reprobate men, yet we are reſtored without them. The conſideration of our fall ſhould humble vs, for in it we are worſe than the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; they haue fallen from their glory, but not with their owne will; we are fallen from ours, and we cannot excuſe our ſelues, but it was with our will: Againe, the hope of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould greatly comfort vs, conſidering that the Lord hath vouchſafed that mercy vnto vs, which hee hath denyed vnto others.</p>

To make this yet more cleare, wee are to know that there are three obiects of Sathans malice. The firſt is God and his glory: the ſecond is man and his ſaluation: the third is the creature, made for Gods glory and mans good.

And if here alſo he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, by reaſon that the Lord hath made a hedge round about man, he turnes him to the third obiect of his malice, which is the creature; againſt which he is ſo inſatiable, that if he can be licenſed to doe no more, yet doth hee eſteeme

And thirdly, that the firſt fruits which wee haue are ſufficient pledges to vs of the plenitude and fulneſſe, which afterward we ſhall receiue.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe learnes vs humilitie: <hi>what haſt thou O</hi>

Secondly, it learnes vs thankfulneſſe: vvhatſoeuer Grace wee haue receiued wee ſhould returne both the praiſe and the vſe of it to him who
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:22742:142"/> gaue it; as the waters by ſecret conduits come from the Sea, returne againe openly into it, through the troughes, ſo that all men may ſee the returning, albeit they ſaw not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: ſo that Grace which the Lord by his Spirit ſecretly conuayes to the godly, doth againe publikely returne vnto him by prayſe and well doing. And thirdly, it doth teach vs diligence in prayer; if we deſire encreaſe of Grace, we ſhould ſeeke it from him of whom we haue the beginning, and vſe all the meanes, ſuch as hearing, reading, praying, keeping of a good conſcience, by which Grace may grow, and be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in vs.</p>
                        <p>The next thing we obſerue is, that in this life we receiue<note place="margin">No plenitude but firſt fruits of the Spirit haue we now.</note> not the plenitude and fulneſſe of Grace, but onely the firſt fruits thereof. The vſe of this is, firſt to comfort the children of God, who are oftentimes diſcouraged with the ſenſe and feeling of their owne wants. It is one of Sathans ſtratagems to try thoſe by the rule of perfection, who are yet but in the ſtate of proficients, and we had neede to beware of it. Shall I<note place="margin">Therefore are we not to think that wee haue no grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> giue that vantage to the aduerſary, as to thinke I haue no faith, becauſe it is weake? or I haue no loue, becauſe it is little: or no ſatisfaction, becauſe it is but in a beginning? No, but I will ſo hunger and thirſt for more grace, that I will ſtill giue thanks for the grace I haue receiued; for here wee haue no fulneſſe, our greateſt meaſure is as the firſt fruits, in reſpect of that which is to come.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, becauſe euery comfort which is giuen<note place="margin">This comfort vainly abuſed by prophane men.</note> to the godly, is turned by prophane contemners and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, into an occaſion and nouriſhment of ſinne: they are to know this comfort belongs not vnto them: It is a common thing to them to excuſe the want of all Grace. O it is but a ſmall grace which in this life is communicated to the beſt, and they think their ſinnes are wel enough couered, by this that all men are ſinners, as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſinne tyrannizing in the vvicked, and captiued in the godly, or as if beginnings of Grace in the regenerate did not ſeperate them in regard of conuerſation from the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:22742:142"/> vnregenerate who are void of all Grace. Let them therefore know that the Spirit of God whom the godly receiue, is not onely called the firſt fruits, the earneſt, and the witneſſe of God, but alſo the ſeale and ſignet of the liuing God. As a ſeale leaues in the waxe that ſimilitude and impreſſion of the forme which is in it ſelfe; ſo the Spirit of God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his owne image to all thoſe whom he ſeales againſt the day of redemption, hee makes them new and holy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And this conuinces carnall profeſſors of a lye, vvho ſay they haue receiued the firſt fruits of the Spirit, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that their works be wicked and vncleane: they may rather, if they vvould tell the truth, ſay as thoſe who being demaunded whether they had receiued the holy Ghoſt or no, anſwered we know not whether there be an holy Ghoſt or no: ſo may they inſtead of bragging of the firſt fruits of the Spirit, ſay in truth wee know not what yee call the firſt fruits of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>And thirdly, out of this deſcription we may gather, that<note place="margin">Why the Lord giues vs not in this life the principall, as well as the earneſt.</note> albeit we haue no more but the firſt fruits of the Spirit, yet are they ſufficient to aſſure vs, that hereafter we ſhall enioy the whole Maſſe. In two reſpects it is cuſtomable to men to giue an earneſt penny in buying and ſelling, eyther when the ſumme is greater then they are able to pay for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or when the thing bought is of that nature, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſently be deliuered: but betweene the Lord and vs there is no buying nor ſelling, he giues freely vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both the earneſt and the principal, but firſt the one, and then the other; not that the Lord is vnable to pay preſently all that he hath promiſed, but becauſe the principall is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it cannot be receiued, till we be prepared for it. As the husbandman muſt ſow and tarry vvith patience till the harueſt come, wherein hee may ſheare: as the warriour muſt fight before he obtaine the victory; and the wreſtler receiues not his crowne till hee haue ouercome, neither doth he that runnes in a race obtaine the priſe, till he haue finiſhed it: ſo muſt the Chriſtian, in all theſe be exerciſed,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:22742:143"/> before that the Lord poſſeſſe him in the promiſed king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                        <p>And though payment of the principall for a time be<note place="margin">What comfort wee haue now in the earneſt and firſt fruits of the Spirit.</note> delayed, yet for our comfort, the earneſt and firſt fruits are preſently deliuered vnto vs, the Lord ſo dealing with vs as he dealt with Iſrael in the Wilderneſſe, when he cauſed the twelue ſpies to bring with them from the riuer of <hi>Eſchol,</hi> a branch of the Vine tree, ſo full of the cluſters of grapes, that it vvas borne betweene two vpon a tree, together with the figges, and pomegranats, and other fruits of that land: for no other end, but that Iſrael taſting of the firſt fruits of Canaan might be prouoked to a more earneſt deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as alſo to aſſure them that the Lord who had giuen them the beginnings, vvould alſo put them in poſſeſſion of the vvhole, accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That wee may ſee the weakeneſſe of their reaſon, wee will firſt compare Faith and Hope, in that relation which they haue to Chriſt: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in that relation which they haue mutually among themſelues. For we deny not, that Faith, Hope, and Loue, each one of them haue a place in the worke of our ſaluation,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:22742:147"/> but the queſtion betweene vs and them is, concerning the right placing of them. Firſt, then it is certaine, that both<note place="margin">Faith &amp; Hope compared in their relation to Chriſt.</note> Faith and Hope looke vnto Chriſt; Ieſus Chriſt and that vvhich hee hath conquered vnto vs, is the obiect of them both, but diuerſly: for faith enters vs into a preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt and his benefits, <hi>he that beleeueth in me</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 36.</note> our Sauiour) <hi>hath eternall life,</hi> hee ſaith not onely hee ſhall haue it, but alſo that preſently hee hath it. Hope againe lookes for a future poſſeſſion of Chriſt, which ſhall be much more excellent, than that which preſently we enioy; for the poſſeſſion of Chriſt which now I haue by Faith is<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9. 10.</note> imperfect and mediate; by Faith I know Chriſt but in part, by Faith I apprehend him but in part alſo: and this poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I haue it mediately, to wit, by the meanes of the Word and Sacraments; but my hope directs mee to looke for a more excellent poſſeſſion of Chriſt, within a ſhort while, in whom I ſhall enioy much more than now by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Faith I can ſee in him, or yet by apprehenſion of my Faith I can comprehend of him. And this is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and immediate poſſeſſion of Chriſt which by Hope we looke for.</p>
                        <p>Now as for their mutuall relation among themſelues,<note place="margin">Faith and hope compared in their mutuall relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> Faith is of things paſt, preſent, and to come; Hope is onely of things to come: Faith is more largely extended than Hope: we hope for nothing vvhich vve beleeue not, but ſomething vvee beleeue for vvhich vve hope not: vve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the paines of hell abide the wicked, but we hope them not; for hope is an expectation of good to come, they may fall vnder feare, but come not vnder hope. Againe, Faith is the mother of Hope; for of that imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and apprehenſion of Chriſt which I haue by Faith, there ariſeth in mee an hope and expectation of a better: Hope againe, is not onely the daughter of Faith, but the conſeruer and nouriſher of Faith, the piller that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>props it, when it faints; for in this life wee are beſet vvith ſo manifold tentations, the worke of God ſeeming oftentimes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:22742:148"/> contrary to his word, and things appearing to fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the Lord hath promiſed, that our Faith thereby is wonderfully daunted, and therefore hath need to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Hope, vvhich teacheth alwayes with patience to depend vpon Gods truth, and to looke for a better. As for example, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>I will heare thee, and deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> according to this promiſe the Chriſtian calling vpon God and yet not finding deliuerance, his Faith begins to faint, but then Hope comes in, and ſuccoureth Faith, and her counſell is, <hi>the viſion is for an appointed time, at laſt it ſhall</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Habak. 2. 3.</note>

                        <p>And of this it is euident, in what ſenſe it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note place="margin">The right place aſsigned to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe three, Faith, Hope, &amp; Loue, in the worke of ſaluation.</note> ſaith, wee are ſaued by Hope, to vvit, becauſe by it vvee are vpholden in trouble: for he is not here diſputing of the manner of our Iuſtification (which he hath done before) but diſcourſing of thoſe comforts vvhich we haue to ſuſtaine vs in affliction. If ye aske by which of theſe three, Faith, Hope, and Loue, we are iuſtified, that is, by which of them we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Chriſts righteouſnes offered to vs in the Goſpell, the Apoſtle hath aunſwered already, wee are iuſtified by Faith. If ye demand which of theſe three chiefely ſuſtaines vs in affliction: the Apoſtle here telleth you, that vvhen Faith is weake, Hope ſaues vs that vve deſpaire not: and if yee demand which of theſe three declares vs to be men iuſtified by Faith in Chriſt, the Apoſtle telleth you, vvee muſt declare our Faith by good workes; for Faith vvorketh by Loue: theſe are the right places, which theſe three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces of the Spirit hath in the worke of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they goe ſo ioyntly together, that they cannot be ſundred:</p>
                        <p>When we ſay that a man is iuſtified by Faith onely, vve doe not therefore make the iuſtified man to be vvithout
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:22742:148"/> Hope and Loue. For albeit in the action of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">The doctrine of Iuſtification by faith onely, takes not away Hope &amp; Loue.</note> and applying of Chriſts righteouſneſſe. Faith onely workes, for which we ſay truely wee are iuſtified by Faith onely, yet Hope and Loue haue other actions pertaining to ſaluation, neceſſarily requiſite in the iuſtified man. And this doth cleare vs of that falſe calumnie wherewith the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries doe charge vs, as if we did teach, that Faith might<note place="margin">Calumnie of the aduerſarie concerning this confuted.</note> be without Hope or Loue. becauſe we affirme that vve are iuſtified by Faith onely. I ſay moſt truely, vvhen I ſay that among all the members of the body, the eye onely ſees, but if any man collect of my ſpeech, that the eye is onely in the body, without eare or hand, he concludes wrong. For albeit in the facultie of ſeeing I ſay the eye onely ſees, yet doe I not for that ſeperate it from the communion of the reſt of the members of the body. In the Sunne heat and light goe inſeparably together; of theſe two it is the heat onely that warmes vs, doe I therefore ſay that the heat is without the light? Among all the graces of the Spirit, when I ſay that Faith onely iuſtifies, I doe but point out the proper action of Faith, but doe not therefore ſeperate it from Hope and Loue. So farre iniurious are the aduerſaries of the truth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, when they accuſe vs for maintaining a Faith which is without Hope, and doth not worke by Loue, which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer affirmed.</p>
                        <p>Of this now it is euident, that the Hope of a Chriſtian<note place="margin">Hope of a Chriſtian is a ſtrong thing, depending on ſure warrants.</note> muſt be very ſtrong, ſeeing it ſuſtaines him in trouble; it is a pillar that ſuſtaines the whole building, and a moſt ſure anchor, which being faſtned vpon the rocke Chriſt Ieſus, holds vs ſo faſt, that we who are weake veſſels, toſt too and fro vvith reſtles tribulations, cannot be ouercome; it leanes vpon moſt certaine vvarrants, vvhereof now we will onely conſider a few.</p>

Againe, compare me theſe two together, that the Father ſpeaking from heauen, ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>this is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well</hi>

Call not therefore any more vpon vs to follow you and to drinke with you of your periſhing pleaſures, we haue had a proofe of yours, &amp; found them to be vanitie; but if yee will, come and take a proofe of ours, will you taſte of thoſe delicates whereunto GOD hath called vs? will you eate of the fruit that growes vpon the tree of life, diſcouered by the Goſpell, vnder the ſhadow whereof wee delight to ſit? righteouſneſſe ſhall breed you peace, and peace ſhall breed you ioy in the holy Ghoſt, and theſe ſhall in ſuch ſort delight you, that in regard of them, your ſoule ſhall loath all your former vaine pleaſures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you delighted before.</p>
                        <p>Of this we may ſee further, that as Faith procreates hope,<note place="margin">Impatience in trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the want of Hope.</note> ſo hope procreates Patience: ſo that the want of Patience in trouble bewrayes the want of Hope. What made <hi>Saul</hi> who in his firſt beginning draue Witches out of the land, in his latter end to make his refuge to them? ſurely becauſe all hope had failed him that the Lord would anſwere him any more. When Samaria was beſieged and ſtraited with Famine, as long as <hi>Iehoram</hi> had any hope hee waited with patience vpon the vvord of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that there ſhould be great plenty ſhortly in Samaria, but when by the womans
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:22742:152"/> complaint hee vnderſtood that the Famine was encreaſt to that height, that his ſubiects were forced to eate their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his hope failed him, and he concludes to attend no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon the Lord, but vowes in his impatience to cut off the head of <hi>Eliſha.</hi> Thus the cauſe of all impatience in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that driues men to ſeeke deliuerance by wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes, is onely the want of hope.</p>
                        <p>Againe, if yee looke to thoſe vvho in proſperitie layes<note place="margin">Licentiouſnes in proſperitie proceeds from the want of hope.</note> downe the raynes of their affections with all licentiouſneſſe to goe after their deſired pleaſures, yee ſhall finde the onely cauſe thereof is the want of hope, <hi>hee that hath</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn) this hope in himſelfe that he ſhall ſee God, purges himſelfe, euen as God is pure.</hi> And this our Sauiour teacheth vs more clearely, in the Parable of that ſeruant vvho becauſe hee thought within himſelfe that his Maiſter would not come, began to beat his fellowes inſtead of feeding them. So that the ground of all the Atheiſme of our time, is pointed out to be the vvant of hope: there is no ſinne committed but through impatience, all proceedes of this, that mans vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and proud nature cannot contayne the ſelfe within the limits preſcribed vnto it by the Lord: he that is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with patience is eaſily kept both in peace and vvarre from etremitie of affection. If any man prophane like <hi>Eſau</hi> ſell his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage, that is, forgoe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life for the periſhing pleaſures of this life, it is becauſe he hath no hope; and therefore no meruaile if with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee abide not for a better, but rather in impatience breake after his affections, to embrace thoſe things which are preſent.</p>
                        <p>Among all the graces of the Spirit, this praiſe may be<note place="margin">Without pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence no grace can be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> giuen to Patience, that it is the keeper of the reſt: if our patience be not firſt broken, wee cannot be induced to the committing of any ſinne.

                        <p>Neyther is it without great cauſe that the Lord paſſing<note place="margin">The heart only makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite.</note> by other things, looketh onely to the heart, the heart being the eſſentiall difference that diſtinguiſheth a true Chriſtian from a counterfaite: for outward exerciſes of godlineſſe the hypocrite in appearance may match the holy one.

                        <p>Beſide this, that the Lord hath locked vp the heart of<note place="margin">It is in great wiſedome that God hath loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp the hart of one man from another.</note> one man from another, and hath reſerued the knowledge of the heart to himſelfe onely, the Lord hath done it in great wiſedome: for ſeeing that man diuided himſelfe by ſinne from God, their hearts by nature are ſo diſcordant among themſelues, that if their hearts were as manifeſt to others, as their faces, there could not be a fellowſhip nor ſocietie entertained among men. Looke how many men are in the world, there are as many ſundry iudgements and wils, euery man hauing a kingdome in his breaſt, and ſo carryed away with a deſire of his owne ſuper-excellencie, that he ſeeketh the aduancement of his owne will with the ouerthrow of all others, whoſe will is not agreeable to his, if hee might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it. Againe, the heart of man is ſuch a bottomles fountaine of wickedneſſe, that if it vvere manifeſted, the vvorld ſhould be infected vvith viler abhominations, than any that yet are knowne in it: for if the tongue which is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:22742:163"/> but a little member of the body, when it ſomes out but a ſmall part of that filth vvhich abounds in the heart, be ſo forcible as to corrupt the honeſt minds and manners of the hearers, vvhat ſhould be done if the heart it ſelfe were laid open, which is by nature but a ſtincking puddle, and filthy ſtore-houſe of all iniquitie?</p>
                        <p>And further for the comfort of the whole Church of God,<note place="margin">The ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God ouer man appeares in this, that he is vpon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their hearts.</note> and euery member thereof, let vs marke the ſoueraigntie of our God ouer all his creatures in theſe two, that not onely hee is vpon their ſecrets vvhether they vvill or not, for he ſits in their hearts, but alſo hath ſoueraign commandement ouer them, ſo that he can when he will, &amp; will when his glory requires, eyther take their hearts vtterly from them, or turn their owne hearts againſt themſelues, as domeſtick enemies to torment them. And as for the firſt, it is manifeſt out of this place, that the Lord ſitteth vpon the ſecret counſell of the wicked; for hee ſearcheth the heart. It was a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of Aram, that the ſecret concluſion, vvhich he laid with his captaines in his cabinet counſel, concerning the ordering of his battels againſt Iſrael were diſcouered as they were concluded, by <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, vnto the King of Iſrael, and vvho reueiled them to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> but the Lord our God? who ſits as moderator in the counſell of the wicked, whether they will or not to ouerrule their determinations, &amp; direct them to their own end, which is the glory, and good of his church. Let our enemies then take counſell and conſpire together as they will, hee that doth ſit in the heauens ſhal haue them in deriſion. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand, and what he hath decreed ſhall onely come to paſſe: let vs therefore reſt in him.</p>
                        <p>It vvere good for men to conſider this, that albeit man<note place="margin">Man hath but his hart to hold him vp, and God can take it from him, when he will.</note> be ſuſtained and vpholden by his owne heart, ſo that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing can help him if it faile him, yet it is in the Lords power to doe vvith it what he vvill: how oft haue we ſeene that the Lord being angry at man, paſſing by all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, and leauing them whole and ſound, hath
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:22742:164"/> ſtricken the heart with ſuch terrours, that moſt valiant men hauing eyes could not ſee, hauing a tongue could not ſpeak, hauing hands could not ſtrike to defend themſelues, and hauing feete could not doe ſo much as runne away, their heart being taken from them by God, they are left in a ſtrait and comfortleſſe eſtate. But farre more miſerable are they, when the Lord turnes their own hearts againſt themſelues, and makes them a terrour to themſelues. A fearefull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereof vvee haue in <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> who ſeeing nothing<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 6.</note> vvithout him, but the figure of a hand which ſtirred him not, vvas ſo ſtricken and purſued with his owne heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, that his fleſh trembled, his countenance waxed pale, his knees ſmote one againſt another. If man conſidered this, he would be loath to prouoke the Lord vnto anger, ſeeing he can neither ſuſtaine the wrath of God nor eſchew it.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer vvee are taught here, ſeeing our Prayer is a<note place="margin">We haue neede of great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in praier, ſeeing we ſpeak to him who ſearcheth the heart.</note> conference with him who ſearcheth the hart, that we ſhould alway pray with our heart, for otherwiſe if wee draw neere him with our lips our heart being farre from him, he vvill curſe vs as deceiuers, that hauing a male in our flock, doe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a lame thing vnto the Lord: that is, in ſtead of the ſeruice of our hearts, doe offer vnto him the ſeruice of our lips.

As for the firſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſua</hi> put off their ſhooes before they came neere the Lord, ſo are we to remoue out of our hearts vncleane cogitations, and affections, whereby we haue trode in the filth of ſinne, before we pray; for thoſe are neuer lawfull, but moſt vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the time of prayer. As for worldly cogitations they are ſometimes lawfull, but neuer in the time of prayer.

The Apoſtle who ſuffered all ſorts of affliction for the Goſpell, giues this for a reaſon, that the loue of Ieſus conſtrayned him.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:22742:185"/> The neceſſitie of this reaſon ſhall appeare if wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Lord cannot be fruſtrated of his end. Thoſe whom the Lord in his immutable purpoſe hath ordayned to glory, and whom according to that purpoſe he hath called in time, how can it be but all things muſt worke vnto their good? for the vvorking prouidence of God vvhich is the executer of his purpoſe, doth ſo ouer-rule all incidents which fall out in the world, and doth ſo gouerne all ſecondary and inferiour cauſes, that of neceſſitie they are directed to that end, whereunto the ſupreame cauſe of all, to wit, the purpoſe and vvill of God hath ordayned them. This is ſhortly ſet downe in theſe vvords, and more largely explaned in the two verſes following. It is the laſt reaſon of comfort, and the higheſt: for now the Apoſtle leades vs out of our ſelues, and ſets vs vpon that rocke vvhich is higher than vve, hee carries vs by the hand as it vvere out of the earth vp into heauen, and lets vs ſee how our ſaluation is ſo grounded in Gods eternall purpoſe, that no accident in the vvorld can change it.</p>
                        <p>Wee haue here then three things, euery one of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending<note place="margin">Comfort, that the ground of our ſaluation is in God, the tokens thereof in our ſelues.</note> vpon another: the loue of God, flowing from the calling of God, and the calling of God, comming from the purpoſe of God: vnto vvhich the Apoſtle here drawes vs, that we caſting our anchor with the vaile, and reſting in the Lords immutable purpoſe, may haue comfort in all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tentations. It is moſt expedient for the godly to marke this, that our manifolde changes doe not interrupt our peace: let vs conſider that the Lord hath in ſuch ſort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed our ſaluation, that the ground thereof is laid in his owne immutable purpoſe, but the markes and tokens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are placed in vs after our calling: the markes and tokens are changeable, like as wee our ſelues in vvhom they are, are changeable; but the ground holdes faſt, being laid in that vnchangeable God in whom falles no ſhadow of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">Eſay. 46.

In that the Apoſtle ſaith our calling is according to his purpoſe, it teacheth vs to aſcribe the whole praiſe of our ſaluation to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will, and not to our owne foreſeene merits. That poyſon of pride vvhich Sathan poured into our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and by vvhich they aſpyred to be equall with God, doth yet breake forth in their poſterity, the corrupt heart of man euer ayming at this, to ſeeke vnto himſelfe either in part or in whole, the power and praiſe of his owne ſaluation. This is to ſtart vp into the roome of God, and to vſurpe that glory which belongs to the Lord, and he will not giue to any other: than the which no greater ſacriledge can be committed againſt the Lord. O man content thee with that which the Lord offers thee, and let that alone vvhich hee reſerues vnto himſelfe: <hi>My peace</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I giue to you, my glory I will not giue to any other.</hi> The firſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell were Angels, they proclaymed glory and peace, but glory they gaue to God which is on high, and peace they cryed to the children of his good will which are vpon earth. It is enough that peace and ſaluation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be thine, but as for the glory of ſaluation let it remain to the Lord.</p>

                        <p>They inſiſt yet further, and obiects, if the Apoſtle, ſay<note place="margin">Faith &amp; works are not ſimply opponed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for they are inſeperable, but opponed onely in the act of Iuſtification</note> they, in his concluſion (we are iuſtified by Faith without the workes of the Law) did vnderſtand the workes of Grace, then it would follow that he oppones things which are not to be opponed: for workes and Grace, vvorkes and Faith, workes and Chriſt, are not oppoſite, but agrees very wel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the cauſe and effect as the tree and the branch. To this wee anſwere, that Faith and vvorkes agrees well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but there is nothing in the vvorld vvhich agree ſo well the one with the other but in ſome things they may be opponed: as for example; the tree and the branch agrees very vvell together, but if the queſtion be moued whether the tree beares the branch or the branch the tree, in this they are opponed; that vvhich is affirmed of the one muſt
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:22742:205"/> be denied of the other. Againe, there is a very ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betweene a naturall Father and the ſonne, the one of them cannot be without the other: for hee is not a Father, who neuer had a ſonne; neither is he a ſonne, who neuer had a Father: but if this be the queſtion which of them gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to another, here wee muſt oppone them, affirming that of the one, which we denie of the other. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there is a very ſweet harmony and agreement betweene Faith and good vvorkes; but if this be the queſtion, for which of them it is that God doth iuſtifie vs, there we muſt oppone them, affirming with the Apoſtle that wee are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, and not by works: alway the oppoſition is not ſimple, but <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Their ſecond euaſion is a diſtinction of the works of the<note place="margin">Workes not of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law onely, but of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall alſo exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> Law, Morall and Ceremoniall. It is true, ſay they, that the vvorks of the law ceremoniall iuſtifies not, but the vvorkes of the Law Morall iuſtifies. But the Apoſtle in his concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on excludes from iuſtification the works of the Law Morall, for theſe reaſons: hee excludes thoſe vvorkes of which he hath proued both Iewes and Gentiles to be guilty, but ſo it is he hath proued them to be guilty of the tranſgreſſion of the Law Morall, as is euident out of the ſinnes wherewith he charges them, therefore, &amp;c. Secondly, hee excludes from iuſtification the vvorks of that Law, by vvhich comes the knowledge of ſinne; but ſo it is the knowledge of ſinne comes by the Law Morall, therefore, &amp;c. <hi>I had not knowne</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that concupiſcence is a ſinne, except the law had ſaid thou ſhalt not couet.</hi> Now it is euident that this is a precept of the Law Morall.</p>
                        <p>Their third euaſion is by a diſtinction of the firſt and<note place="margin">The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt and ſecond Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued.</note> ſecond iuſtification, the firſt vvhereof ſay they is by Faith, but the ſecond is by vvorkes. But this twofold iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alſo forged: for <hi>iustificatio est actus indiuidius &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul totus,</hi> there is no firſt and laſt in the act of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he that is once condemned iudicially ſtands ſo, and he that is abſolued ſtands ſo.

That they are diſtinct benefits the Apoſtle doth teach vs, Chriſt is made to vs righteouſneſſe and ſanctification; but they inconſiderately confound them: for if theſe new qualities infuſed by Grace into the ſoule of man, and good vvorkes flowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from be the matter they ſay of mans ſecond Iuſtification, then let them tell vs vvhat is the matter of his Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this, theſe are two inſeperable benefits, to<note place="margin">Iuſtification &amp; Sanctification inſeperably conioyned.</note> whomſoeuer the Lord imputes the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and giues them Faith to accept it as their owne, like as for it he abſolues them from ſinne and death, and adiudges them vnto life, ſo alſo incontinent works he in them by his holy ſpirit, an inherent righteouſneſſe, by vvhich they become new creatures; ſo that our Iuſtification hath inſeperably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with it Sanctification. But this Sanctification of ours is ſo imperfect, that howſoeuer it be accepted of the Father for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, yet is it not ſo perfect nor ſufficient that for the merit thereof wee dare ſeeke to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued from our ſinnes, and receiued into fauour.</p>
                        <p>

And in very deed this is a proper mark of the children of God, that howeuer their outward eſtate change, their heart is neuer changed from the loue of God; they are godly in proſperitie, but more godly in aduerſitie the more they are troubled the neerer they draw vnto the

                        <p>Secondly, vvorldly pleaſures are of this nature, that if<note place="margin">2 If they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come painfull.</note> they be continued vvithout intermiſſion they turne into paines; therefore is it that thoſe ſame things which now we chooſe for recreation, incontinently they become vveari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto vs, and wee caſt them away, ſo that it is not ſo much by themſelues, as by the change of them that we are delighted, <hi>Sola viciſſitudine recreamur:</hi> being weary of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we refreſh our ſelues with ſitting; againe being wearie of ſitting, we riſe to refreſh our ſelues with vvalking, and ſo fareth it with all the recreations of this life, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they become weariſome.
